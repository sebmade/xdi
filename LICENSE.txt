XDI LICENCE POLICY


1. FREE FOR USE FOR THOSE WHO ARE 100% GPL

If your application is licensed under GPL or compatible OSI license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses&gt>, 
you are free to use XDI with your application. 
By "application" we mean any type of software application, system, tool or utility. 
For doing this, you do not need a separate signed agreement with Improve, because the GPL text is sufficient.


2. FREE USE FOR THOSE WHO NEVER COPY, MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE

As long as you never distribute (internally or externally) XDI in any way, 
you are free to use it for powering your application, irrespective of whether your application 
is under GPL or other OSI approved license or not.

More specifically:

Modifying - You are allowed to modify XDI source code any way you like. If you distribute the modified version, all changes, all interface code and all code that connects directly or indirectly to the interface code fall under GPL.

Copying - You are allowed to copy XDI binaries and source code, but when you do so, the copies will fall under the GPL license.


3. COMMERCIAL USE FOR EVERYONE ELSE

If your application is not licensed under GPL or compatible OSI license, you must first obtain an agreement from Improve.
